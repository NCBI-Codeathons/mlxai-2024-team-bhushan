## Project Goals

The scientific goal of the project is to build AI/ML model to predict the impact of a bacterial species on human intestinal function in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), specifying, drug absorption & metabolism.

## Approach

1. Find changes in genes of interest (drug absorption, metabolism) due to IBD
    1. Find pharmacokinetic response of IBD patients to drugs, or
    2. Find dataset on patient response to drugs relevant in IBD
2. Find relative abundance of bacterial species relevant in IBD
    1. Identify and obtain microbial features that will be used for AI/ML
3. Develop an AI/ML model to predict effect of bacteria on genes/pathways
    1. Find host-microbiome interactions relevant to IBD
    2. Create training set and identify AI/ML models
    3. Classify bacterial species that similarly affect (similar) genes/pathways
    4. Predict drug absorption/metabolism based upon this
